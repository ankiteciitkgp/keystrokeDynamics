# Keystroke Dynamics
## 1.1 Introduction
Keystroke dynamics is the study of whether people can be distinguished by their typing
rhythms, much like handwriting is used to identify the author of a written text. Possible
applications include acting as an electronic fingerprint, or in an access-control mecha-
nism. A digital fingerprint would tie a person to a computer-based crime in the same
manner that a physical fingerprint ties a person to the scene of a physical crime. Access
control could incorporate keystroke dynamics both by requiring a legitimate user to type
a password with the correct rhythm, and by continually authenticating that user while
they type on the keyboard. Keystroke dynamics is a behavioral biometric, this means
that the biometric factor is ’something you do’.
## 1.2 Methods
The methods for collecting the data, extracting the features and building the classifier
are described in this section.
### 1.2.1 Data Acquisition
A keylogger was used to collect the keystroke data for all the group members. This was
collected in the form of :
• ”Key Event” - whether a button was pressed or released.
• ”Key Code” - which button was pressed.
